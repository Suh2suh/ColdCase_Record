## Folder Structure

- #### Imported Packages (Extra)
  The folder that contains only imported packages or plugins, literally. Added for reason to avoid error or warning while navigating "Scripts" folder.

- <b>Scripts (Main)</b>: The folder that contains codes written by me only.
  - <b>~</b>: ~ this will be updated, since folder structure is re-organized today [250201]
